# pyomexmeta Demonstration Notebook

We provide here a Python Jupyter Notebook which demonstrates the use of `pyomexmeta` - the Python interface to [libOmexMeta](https://github.com/sys-bio/libOmexMeta).
In this demonstration we illustrate the creation of annotations for models encoded in the [SBML](http://sbml.org) and [CellML](https://cellml.org) formats as described in the OMEX Metadata Specification version 1.1.
